<H1>The FLAIR-GG FDP Index Proxy</H1>


<br/>
It is possible to join the network by simply providing a metadata document that follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/">DCAT</a> standard, and providing the core set of metadata elements required by the FLAIR-GG platform
<br/><br/>
To do this, you must use our FDP Proxy, which will add additional required metadata to your DCAT, 
and will set-up a "ping" such that your docuemnt is re-tested every week, and any new modifications are absorbed by the platform.

<br/><br/>
To pass your document to the Proxy, use the following CURL command:
<br/><br/>

<code>curl -v -L -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"clientUrl": "https://my.server.org/my_dcat_record.ttl"}' https://bgv.cbgp.upm.es/fdp-index-proxy/proxy</code>
